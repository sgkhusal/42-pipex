Swim Good
Machine Gun Kelly

Hey, That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it?
(Town car ain't it, ain't it)
Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it, yeah
Now I'm ridin' 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleedin'
(Trunk bleedin', bleedin')
And every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them
They never see them
And I've got this black suit on (suit on, suit on)
Ridin' around like I'm ready for a funeral
Five more miles 'til the road runs out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good

I'm drowning in your holy water hold me under longer
Hold this rib that I gave you, just don't pierce my under-armour
Undercovers with the laying and sheets that are Devil-colored
Gun through the teeth at your brain if you're thinkin' 'bout another, bang
Same vintage leather jacket with secret pockets (yeah)
Skeletons in my closet next to the sneaker options (yeah)
Fashion killer, look inside you could see the coffins
The 'caine ables me to function nice when my body's stoppin'
I'm Scarface smokin' in this bath water
My guitar case really just a cash holder (cash)
Gun attached for the task force, ready for a car chase
Nothing's too fast for it yeah, yeah

I'm about to drive in the ocean (drive in the ocean)
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim Good (swim good), and swim Good (and swim good)
Take off this suit
And swim Good, and swim good
